## Epicodus Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Curriculum

---

Epicodus is committed to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion (DEI) in the tech industry. For that reason, we've made our DEI and other diversity-related curriculum available publicly.

* [dei-lessons](https://github.com/epicodus-classroom/DEI-curriculum/tree/master/dei-lessons) includes all general lessons on DEI in our curriculum. Topics include identifying and preventing microaggressions, addressing implicit bias, understanding stereotype threat, and others. 

* [dei-reflections](https://github.com/epicodus-classroom/dei-curriculum/tree/master/dei-reflections) includes the reflective assignment that's tied to each of our DEI lessons. This curriculum is currently optional for our students. 

Currently our DEI lessons are spread out accross the full program:

  * **Section 1**: Introduction to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Curriculum
  * **Section 2**: Equality versus Equity
  * **Section 3**: Identifying and Preventing Microaggressions
  * **Section 4**: Imposter Syndrome
  * **Section 5**: Asking and Listening
  * **Section 6**: Speaking Up
  * **Section 8**: Recognizing Privilege
  * **Section 10**: Inclusive Terminology: Using a Main Branch
  * **Section 12**: Jokes and Appropriate Humor
  * **Section 15**: Addressing Implicit Bias
  * **Section 17**: Understanding Stereotype Threat
  * **Section 19**: Economic Benefits of Diversity in Tech

All of these lessons can be found live on our website:

We're also offering periodic **DEI Workshops**, about every 5 weeks, on these topics:

  * **Workshop A**: Worldview and Bias
  * **Workshop B**: Allyship Engagement
  * **Workshop C**: Deconstructing White Supremacy
  * **Workshop D**: Entering the Tech Field

In these workshops students briefly learn about a topic, and then break out into small groups to discuss prompts on the workshop's topic. We then come back as a large group to discuss.

We've done our best to compile information and resources here that are helpful to our students, but we don't want to claim that we're experts in DEI. If you have suggestions or concerns, pull requests and issues are welcome!
