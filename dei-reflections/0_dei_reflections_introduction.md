## [Overview of DEI Reflections](#overview-of-dei-reflections)

---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum at Epicodus includes periodic workshops, a discussion on microaggressions, lessons integrated throughout each learning track, and reflective assignments for each lesson. We outline the DEI curriculum in the lesson [Making Epicodus an Inclusive Place](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/making-epicodus-an-inclusive-place) and we introduce the curriculum more in depth in the lesson [Introduction to DEI curriculum](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-introduction-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-curriculum). Both lessons can be found in the Introduction to Programming course. Separately, you can [visit this link to see all of the DEI lessons](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/dei-lessons).

In this lesson, we’ll discuss the reflective assignments that are tied to each DEI lesson. We also call these assignments “personal reflections”, in which you'll be given a prompt that you’ll write a short, reflective response to.

**Engaging in these reflective assignments is required to graduate from Epicodus!** Whereas our workshops are focused on group work, these reflective assignments are an opportunity for you to reflect and engage with important DEI topics by yourself.

### [How These Assignments Work](#how-these-assignments-work)

You will write your personal reflection directly in Epicenter. Similar to CRs, reflection prompts will have their own page on Epicenter with a text box input. You can write and keep your reflections in a location other than Epicenter, however, when you are finished writing it, you’ll need to copy over your reflection into the input text box on Epicenter. When you select the button to submit your response, it will be recorded in Epicenter.

Every reflective assignment is automatically assigned a pass/fail status based on whether you've submitted a response or not. Your response can be long or short - whatever suits you. However, you must write a response in order for the assignment to be considered passing. There is no grade or staff feedback. However, staff will periodically review responses.

You can edit your personal reflections by returning to the prompt and directly editing your response in the text box. Once you are satisfied, simply click "Resubmit" to record your changes.

Also, you will see a due date for each reflective assignment. This due date lines up to the course section in which the corresponding lesson is assigned. There is no penalty for missing a due date. Rather, it is meant to help you stay on track to complete your personal reflections before you move onto internships. As long as you are enrolled in or an alum of Epicodus, you can access and update any reflection you write.

### [Finding the Reflection Prompts](#finding-the-reflection-prompts)

The reflection prompt is found on Epicenter in the same course that the DEI lesson reading is assigned. In the homepage of every technical course on Epicenter, there are code reviews listed as well as personal reflection prompts.

For example, in “JavaScript and jQuery”, the second section of the _Introduction to Programming_ course, we assign the lesson [Equity versus Equality](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/javascript-and-jquery/homework-equality-versus-equity). That means the reflection prompt for “Equity versus Equality” can be found on Epicenter in the _Introduction to Programming_ course. 

Follow these steps to find the reflection prompt for the DEI lesson you finished reading:

  * Log into _Epicenter_.
  * If you are not already on this page, select _Courses_ from the navigation bar at the top of the page.
  * Select your current course.
  * Then, look for the _Personal reflections_ section within that course. 
  * Find and select the reflection that matches the title of the DEI lesson. This will open the submission page with the reflection prompt.

### [Giving Feedback](#giving-feedback)

We hope you find these reflective assignments to be thought-provoking! We always welcome feedback on your experience of the DEI curriculum, including these reflective assignments. We outline all of the ways you can give feedback in [the student handbook](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#giving-feedback).
