## [Overview of DEI Reflections](#overview-of-dei-reflections)

---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum at Epicodus includes periodic workshops, a discussion on microaggressions, written lessons integrated throughout each learning track, and reflective assignments for each written lesson. We outline the DEI curriculum in the lesson [Making Epicodus an Inclusive Place](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/making-epicodus-an-inclusive-place) and we introduce the curriculum more in depth in the lesson [Introduction to DEI curriculum](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-introduction-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-curriculum). Both lessons can be found in the Introduction to Programming course. Separately, you can [visit this link to see all of the DEI lessons](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/dei-lessons).

In this lesson, we’ll discuss the reflective assignments that are tied to each DEI lesson. We also call these assignments “reflections”, in which you'll be given a prompt that you’ll write a short, reflective response to.

**Engaging in these reflective assignments is optional, but highly encouraged!** Whereas our workshops are focused on group work, these reflective assignments are an opportunity for you to reflect and engage with important DEI topics by yourself.

### [How These Assignments Work](#how-these-assignments-work)

You will write your reflection directly in Epicenter. Similar to CRs, reflection prompts will have their own page on Epicenter with a text box input. You can write and keep your reflections in a location other than Epicenter, however, when you are finished writing it, you’ll need to copy over your reflection into the input text box on Epicenter. When you select the button to submit your response, it will be recorded in Epicenter.

Every reflective assignment is automatically assigned a pass/fail status based on whether you've submitted a response or not. Your response can be long or short - whatever suits you. However, you must write a response in order for the assignment to be considered passing. There is no grade or staff feedback. However, staff will periodically review responses.

Also, you will see a due date for each reflective assignment. This due date lines up to the course section in which the lesson reading is assigned. As we mentioned, these assignments are optional, so there is no penalty for missing a due date. As long as you are enrolled in or an alum of Epicodus, you can access any reflection you write, including updating and deleting your submission.

### [Finding the Reflection Prompts](#finding-the-reflection-prompts)

Similar to code reviews, the prompts for your reflections are found in the courses tab on Epicenter, in a section titled “Reflections”. The reflection prompt is found in the same course that the DEI lesson reading was originally assigned. 

For example, in “JavaScript and jQuery”, section 2 of the Introduction to Programming course, we assign the lesson [Equity versus Equality](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/javascript-and-jquery/homework-equality-versus-equity). That means the reflection prompt for “Equity versus Equality” can be found on Epicenter in the Introduction to Programming course.  

### [Giving Feedback](#giving-feedback)

We hope you find these reflective assignments to be thought-provoking! We always welcome feedback on your experience of the DEI curriculum, including these reflective assignments. We outline all of the ways you can give feedback in [the student handbook](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#giving-feedback).
