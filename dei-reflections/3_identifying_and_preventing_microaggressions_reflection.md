## Overview of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reflections
---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum at Epicodus includes periodic workshops, a discussion on microaggressions, written lessons integrated throughout each learning track, and reflective assignments for each written lesson. We call these reflective assignments "reflections", where you'll write a short response to a prompt on the topic of the corresponding DEI lesson. 

Engaging in these reflective assignments is optional, but highly encouraged! Whereas our workshops are focused on group work, these reflective assignments are an opportunity for you to reflect and engage with important DEI topics by yourself.

You will write your reflection directly in Epicenter. Similar to CRs, reflection prompts will have their own page on Epicenter with a text box input. You can write and keep your reflections in a location other than Epicenter, however, when you are finished writing it, youâ€™ll need to copy over your reflection into the input text box on Epicenter. Scroll down on this page to find the text box! When you select the button to submit your response, it will be recorded in Epicenter. Unlike with CRs, there is no option to submit a link to another site where you keep your reflections.

Every reflective assignment is automatically assigned a pass/fail status based on whether you've submitted a response or not. Your response can be long or short - whatever suits you. However, you must write a response in order for the assignment to be considered passing. There is no grade or staff feedback. However, staff will periodically review responses.

Also, you will see a due date for each reflective assignment. This due date lines up to the course section in which the lesson reading is assigned. As we mentioned, these assignments are optional, so there is no penalty for missing a due date. As long as you are enrolled in or an alum of Epicodus, you can access any reflection you write, including updating and deleting your submission.

We hope you find these reflective assignments to be thought-provoking! We always welcome feedback on your experience of the DEI curriculum, including these reflective assignments. We outline all of the ways you can give feedback in [the student handbook](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#giving-feedback).
